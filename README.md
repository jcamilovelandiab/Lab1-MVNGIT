# AREM Laboratory #1

In this laboratory a generic linked list was implemented. The mean and standard deviation were calculated based on the linked list elements.

The linked list was implemented with a Node class. The node class has the following structure:

[]()

A data that is the nodeâ€™s value, and next what is the neighboor on the right (The node that it is pointing at).
